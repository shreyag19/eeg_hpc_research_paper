# Classification of EEG Signals and Application of HPC using PARAM on the Algorithms for Performance Optimization.

Non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are distinguished by the method used to assess brain 
activity and the manner in which distinct brain signals are converted into commands that operate an effector. 
Many people's lives have been changed by Brain-Computer Interfaces, particularly those whose movement and ability to 
communicate are impaired. In this study, we evaluate different classification algorithms using different dimensionality 
reduction techniques on the dataset containing visual evoked, steady state visual evoked and motor image EEG signals. 
Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, Random forest, Decision trees, boosting models and neural networks 
have been used for binary and multiclass classification. Other than evaluating the accuracies of the classifying models, 
the computational time of each algorithm is observed and high performance computing was applied using PARAM Siddhi AI 
to optimize the performance of the algorithms.
